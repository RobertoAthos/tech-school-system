## üë• How to use the system

### Conta Admin

You can log-in as admin, where you will have the freedom to create student and teacher accounts. To access the admin account add to the url **/adminLogin**

**Register Number** : TEC154SFASGA <br>

**Password** : thmpv2732

With these credentials above you can login as admin.

### How to know the passwords of the created accounts.

As soon as the student, teacher and even another admin account is created, the password will always be the name with its capital initials along with the department number, for example:

Departments : <br>

Maternal/Jardin de inf√¢ncia = 01 <br>

Fundamental 1 = 02 <br> 

Fundamental 2 = 03 <br>

Ensino M√©dio = 04 <br>

Assuming you are creating an account for a student, his name is Pedro and he is from maternal 1, so his password will be = **Pedro02** <br>

For the admin it will just be ADM + the department number.
